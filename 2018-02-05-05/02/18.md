In this lesson we were learning about coding and decoding letters with code in google sheets.

We would functions like iferror and vlookup after writing out the alphabet and the letters after coding in a way so if we typed letters into one column it would show what the coded version of the phtase typed in. Decoding used a very similar layout.
